            <p>Hello, I am Mahtamun Haque Fahim from Bangladesh. I am simultaneously a student, graphic
                designer,
                front-end web designer, debater, and bookworm.</p>

        <div class="break">
            <p>I was born on May 22, 2005, and my studies started in 2010. In 2011, I started primary
                school.
                When
                I was in 5th grade, I got GPA-5 and passed the PECE exam. In 2016, I was admitted to Govt.
                Muslim
                High School,
                Chattogram. In 2018, I got GPA-4.8 and passed from Govt. Muslim High School in the JSC exam
                successfully. I am currently studying in the 10th class and am preparing for SSC Exam-2021
                to be
                held in a few months. After the SSC exam, I have to go to college. I hope that would be
                another
                long
                journey!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="break">
            <p>My goal is to be a full-stack web developer and so I'm trying to build myself from now on.
                Currently, I can do HTML, CSS a lot better and I am learning JavaScript. My next goal is to
                build
                myself
                up as a good frontend web developer. Then I desire to gradually become a full stack web
                developer by focusing on full-stack web development.
                Till then stay with me.</p>
